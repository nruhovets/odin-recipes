    <h2>Baked Beans Recipe</h2>
    <p>This Quick Southern-Style Baked Beans recipe is by Pam Anderson. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices bacon, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 medium green pepper, cut into small dice</li>
        <li>3 large cans (28 ounces each) pork and beans</li>
        <li>3/4 c. barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 c. brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 c. distilled or cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tsp. dry mustard or 2 tablespoons Dijon</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.</li>
        <li>Fry bacon in large, deep sauté pan skillet until bacon has partially cooked and released about 1/4 cup drippings. Remove bacon from pan and drain on paper towels. </li>
        <li>Add onions and peppers to drippings in pan and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add beans and remaining ingredients bring to a simmer. (If skillet is not large enough, add beans and heat to a simmer then transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining ingredients). </li>
        <li>Pour flavored beans into a greased 13-by 9-inch (or similar size) ovenproof pan. Top with bacon, then bake until beans are bubbly and sauce is the consistency of pancake syrup, about 2 hours. Let stand to thicken slightly and serve.</li>
